                                        <p>I am a Graduate student pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Engineering. I am persistent, dedicated, and needless to say a tech enthusiast. I have a prior work experience of 3+ years in a service-based IT company called Capgemini. My work included building end-to-end web applications that especially involve application modernization and digital transformation of Legacy systems.

I was an integral part of the development team of the "NamasteCapgemini" application which got nominated to Aegis Grahambell awards in the COVID combat innovation category in the year 2020.

I love to learn and teach new things. I have had experience in conducting training and workshops at different levels within the organization. Apart from being a techie, I love doing standup comedy and watching movies.

I am open to opportunities in the field of web/native application development, AI/ML, and cloud computing.</p>
